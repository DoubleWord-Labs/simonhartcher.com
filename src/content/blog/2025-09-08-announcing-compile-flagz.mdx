When using Zig's build system for C/C++ projects, editors struggle to find include paths and provide proper code intelligence. [compile_flagz](https://github.com/deevus/compile_flagz) solves this by automatically generating `compile_flags.txt` from your `build.zig` configuration.

## The Problem

Recently I've been working on [ROLLER](https://github.com/FatalDecomp/ROLLER), a decompilation project for the 1995 game, Fatal Racing (or Whiplash in NA). [The game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Racing) (known internally as Roller), is an early 3D game written in C with a bespoke engine. It also happens to be one of my favourite games from the 90s. I remember playing it a whole lot as a teenager with my best friend after we found it on a [WAREZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez) CD. I've since fixed the error of my ways and secured a physical copy a few years ago. You can read more about it [here](/posts/2025-03-27-adventures-in-game-development).

Zig provides a powerful build system, and it ships a C/C++ compiler using LLVM. It can make cross-compilation of projects a breeze, allowing you to build for just about any target you want. (Note: unfortunately it's [not currently possible](https://github.com/castholm/SDL?tab=readme-ov-file#macos) to cross-compile SDL from Linux to MacOS.)

However when working with said C/C++ code with Zig as your build system, your editor (or IDE) won't be able to find the necessary include paths or libraries to make the developer experience seamless.

Your editor needs some way to determine where your includes live so that it can provide rich code completion and error highlighting. Consider the following code from ROLLER:

```c
// File: roller.c
// Without include paths, your editor won't know where to find the SDL_image header file.
#include <SDL3_image/SDL_image.h>

// ...

int InitSDL()
{
    // ...
    s_pWindowTexture = SDL_CreateTexture(s_pRenderer, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB24, SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING, 640, 400);
    SDL_SetTextureScaleMode(s_pWindowTexture, SDL_SCALEMODE_NEAREST);
    s_pDebugTexture = SDL_CreateTexture(s_pRenderer, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB24, SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING, 64, 64);
    SDL_SetTextureScaleMode(s_pDebugTexture, SDL_SCALEMODE_NEAREST);
    s_pRGBBuffer = malloc(640 * 400 * 3);
    s_pDebugBuffer = malloc(64 * 64 * 3);

    // This will build fine, but the editor doesn't know what this is
    SDL_Surface *pIcon = IMG_Load("roller.ico");
    SDL_SetWindowIcon(s_pWindow, pIcon);
    // ...
}
```

In most cases the `SDL_image` header will not be found and you get red squiggles.

When programming, there is nothing worse than trying to work with a codebase when you can't navigate to the source code or get basic auto-complete for a library.

## Enter compile_flagz

My package [compile_flagz](https://github.com/deevus/compile_flagz) aims to solve this problem by generating a [compile commands file](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/compile-commands). In this case: `compile_flags.txt`. This file is a standard format that language servers like clangd use to understand your project's compilation settings. For ROLLER it looks like this:

```shell
-I/home/sh/.cache/zig/p/sdl-0.3.0+3.2.22-7uIn9Pg3fwGG2IyIOPxxOSVe-75nUng9clt7tXGFLzMr/include
-I/home/sh/.cache/zig/p/N-V-__8AAJB7IgJ65BPSqjqzt7j-5xKDklR0h8c11T60iemj/include
-I/home/sh/.cache/zig/p/wildmidi-0.4.6-fQncf6jFDgCtSOKbYs0wEaUZ4n1vMUKaU3OWGXfQD9cL/include
```

These are the Zig cache paths for SDL, SDL_image, and Wildmidi respectively.

### How It Works

After adding it as a dependency to your project:

```shell
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/deevus/compile_flagz
```

At a high level, the process is as follows:

1. Import `compile_flagz` directly into your `build.zig` file. (Note: not using `b.dependency`)
2. Create a `CompileFlags` instance by calling `compile_flags.addCompileFlags(b)`.
3. Add your include paths using `CompileFlags.addIncludePath`.
4. Create a `compile-flags` step so that you can generate `compile_flags.txt` on demand.
5. (Optional) Make your top level build step depend on the compile flags step.
6. When the `compile-flags` step is run, it will generate `compile_flags.txt` in the root of your project.

## Real-World Example

Our setup for it in `build.zig` looks like this:

```zig
fn configureDependencies(b: *Build, exe: *Compile, target: ResolvedTarget, optimize: OptimizeMode) void {
    const exe_mod = exe.root_module;

    // build dependencies
    const wildmidi = b.dependency("wildmidi", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    const wildmidi_lib = wildmidi.artifact("wildmidi");

    const sdl_image = b.dependency("SDL_image", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    const sdl_image_lib = sdl_image.artifact("SDL3_image");

    const sdl = b.dependency("sdl", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
        .lto = .none,
    });
    const sdl_lib = sdl.artifact("SDL3");

    exe_mod.linkLibrary(sdl_lib);
    exe_mod.linkLibrary(sdl_image_lib);
    exe_mod.linkLibrary(wildmidi_lib);

    const sdl_image_source = sdl_image.builder.dependency("SDL_image", .{
        .lto = .none,
    });

    var cflags = compile_flagz.addCompileFlags(b);
    cflags.addIncludePath(sdl.builder.path("include"));
    cflags.addIncludePath(sdl_image_source.builder.path("include"));
    cflags.addIncludePath(wildmidi.builder.path("include"));

    const cflags_step = b.step("compile-flags", "Generate compile flags");
    cflags_step.dependOn(&cflags.step);
}

const compile_flagz = @import("compile_flagz");
```

The result is that your editor can now resolve your project's dependencies.

## Quick Start

Here's the minimal code you need to get started:

```zig
// In your build.zig
const compile_flagz = @import("compile_flagz");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    // Your existing build setup...

    // Add compile_flagz
    var cflags = compile_flagz.addCompileFlags(b);
    cflags.addIncludePath(your_dependency.path("include"));

    // Create the step
    const cflags_step = b.step("compile-flags", "Generate compile flags");
    cflags_step.dependOn(&cflags.step);
}
```

Then run `zig build compile-flags` to generate your `compile_flags.txt`.

## Future Plans

The [clang compile commands design page](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/compile-commands) says the following:

> The most critical flags in practice are:
>
>   - Setting the `#include` search path: `-I`, `-isystem`, and others.
>   - Controlling the language variant used: `-x`, `-std` etc
>   - Predefining preprocessor macros, `-D` and friends
>
> Without these flags, clangd will often spectacularly fail to parse source code, generating many spurious errors (e.g. `#included` files not being found).

So far `compile_flagz` only implements the `-I` case. If you need additional features, please open an issue or raise a pull request: https://github.com/deevus/compile_flagz

## Conclusion

If you are considering using Zig as your build system for your C or C++ project (and you should!), consider adding `compile_flagz` to your project. It may greatly improve your development experience.

Give it a try on your next C/C++ project using Zig build, and let me know how it goes. If you find it useful, please star the repository!
