In 'Polygon Peril', you will play the awakened spirit of an uploaded human conciousness trying to free humanity from the prison of digital immortality. A joint project between [TKFY](https://tkfy.co/) and Doubleword Labs, Polygon Peril is envisioned as a topdown, bullet-hell, science fiction drama that questions the quest for eternal life.
