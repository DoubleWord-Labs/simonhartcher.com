It's 2026 and Claude's [voice mode](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11101966-using-voice-mode-on-claude-mobile-apps) still constantly cuts you off mid sentence, at random. Sometimes I can speak for minutes and it listens dutifully. Other times I can't even finish a single sentence before it cuts me off and says something like:

> Oh I think I cut you off there. What were you saying? - Claude

This is [not news](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mdibt4/claudes_voice_is_constantly_cutting_me_off/), it [happens to everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lu3p4t/voice_mode_buggy_for_anyone_else/), is being reported everywhere including incorrectly [on the Claude Code GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4542). I'm currently paying $200 USD a month and it's just not good enough. Even if you're on the $20 plan, it's unacceptable.

Please fix it, Anthropic.
