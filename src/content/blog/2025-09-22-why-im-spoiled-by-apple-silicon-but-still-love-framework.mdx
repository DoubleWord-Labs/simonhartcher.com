I mainly use my MacBook M1 Pro with Apple Silicon for work. Recently I’ve had a few weeks off. It’s been sitting in my laptop bag waiting for me to return to work.

Since I’m back to work tomorrow I got it out to see if it was charged enough for the train journey in the morning. 90% remaining. After 3 weeks. It wasn’t turned off, just closed.

In contrast, my Framework 13 with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS is almost always dead when I go to use it. It’s very frustrating. I’m not using it every day so it often goes 2-3 days without being opened. I haven’t measured it but I read that I should expect it to lose [3-4% in suspend every hour](https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/18c8yk7/high_battery_drain_when_sleeping_amd_13/). Is that a joke?

I was running Fedora Workstation on the 13 for a long while until I had a short stint with Arch Linux. [It wasn’t stable enough](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Framework_Laptop_13#Troubleshooting) so now I’m on Fedora Silverblue which has been delightful.

However, the Framework's battery life continues to be an issue.

I’m a true believer of Framework’s mission. The technology is awesome. But why is the battery life of modern laptops (other than Apple Silicon) so bad? I don’t think it’s unique to Framework, but it affects my love for this groundbreaking device.

Apple Silicon is built upon ARM64 which is apparently [core to such great battery life](https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/22/apple-silicon-macbook-pro-battery-life/). Do I need to get an ARM mainboard as soon as Framework offers it as an upgrade? I’m not sure. It appears to be [way more complicated](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40418192) than just switching to ARM64.

I still love my Framework, despite its flaws. I will just keep it plugged in so that it's ready to go when I want to use it.
