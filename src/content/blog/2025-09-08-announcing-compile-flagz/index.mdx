Recently I've been working on [ROLLER](https://github.com/FatalDecomp/ROLLER), a decompilation project for the 1995 game, Fatal Racing (or Whiplash in NA). [The game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Racing) (known internally as Roller), is an early 3D game written in C with a bespoke engine. It also happens to be one of my favourite games from the 90s. I remember playing it a whole lot as a teenager with my best friend after we found it on a [WAREZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez) CD. I've since fixed the error of my ways and secured a physical copy a few years ago. You can read more about it [here](/posts/2025-03-27-adventures-in-game-development).

## The Problem

Zig provides a very powerful build system, and it ships a C/C++ compiler using LLVM. It can make cross-compilation of projects a breeze, allowing you to build for just about any target you want. (Note: unfortunately it's [not currently possible](https://github.com/castholm/SDL?tab=readme-ov-file#macos) to cross-compile SDL from Linux to MacOS.) However when working with said C/C++ code with Zig as your build system, your IDE won't be able to find the necessary include paths or libraries to make the developer experience seamless.

[DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC PAIN POINT]
