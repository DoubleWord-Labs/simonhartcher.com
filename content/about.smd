I am a CTO/software engineer living in Wollongong, Australia. I am currently the CTO atÂ [Bonjoro](https://www.bonjoro.com/).


I have almost 15 years experience working on both large and small software projects with small to medium sized teams across many technology stacks.


My breadth of experience includes industries such as events, ticketing, sports, statistics, SaaS, customer success, and video marketing. I have a proven track record as a successful manager, leader and engineer and the quality of my work speaks for itself.


In my spare time I try to decipher X86 Assembly in an attempt to reverse engineer MS-DOS era PC games. I also game regularly (my gaming setup is at the bottom of this page). My favourite genre is definitely 4-player co-op PvE games such as Vermintide 2, Deep Rock Galactic and Darktide.
